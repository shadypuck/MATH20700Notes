\section{Continuity}
\emph{From \textcite{bib:Rudin}.}
\subsection*{Chapter 4}
\begin{enumerate}[label={\textbf{\arabic*.}}]
    \item \marginnote{11/29:}Suppose $f$ is a real function defined on $\R^1$ which satisfies
    \begin{equation*}
        \lim_{h\to 0}[f(x+h)-f(x-h)] = 0
    \end{equation*}
    for every $x\in\R^1$. Does this imply that $f$ is continuous?
    \item If $f$ is a continuous mapping of a metric space $X$ into a metric space $Y$, prove that
    \begin{equation*}
        f(\bar{E}) \subset \overline{f(E)}
    \end{equation*}
    for every set $E\subset X$ ($\bar{E}$ denotes the closure of $E$). Show, by an example, that $f(\bar{E})$ can be a proper subset of $\overline{f(E)}$.
    \item Let $f$ be a continuous real function on a metric space $X$. Let $Z(f)$ (the \textbf{zero set} of $f$) be the set of all $p\in X$ at which $f(p)=0$. Prove that $Z(f)$ is closed.
    \item Let $f$ and $g$ be continuous mappings of a metric space $X$ into a metric space $Y$, and let $E$ be a dense subset of $X$. Prove that $f(E)$ is dense in $f(X)$. If $g(p)=f(p)$ for all $p\in E$, prove that $g(p)=f(p)$ for all $p\in X$. (In other words, a continuous mapping is determined by its values on a dense subset of its domain.)
    \item If $f$ is a real continuous function defined on a closed set $E\subset\R^1$, prove that there exist continuous real functions $g$ on $\R^1$ such that $g(x)=f(x)$ for all $x\in E$. (Such functions $g$ are called \textbf{continuous extensions} of $f$ from $E$ to $\R^1$.) Show that the result becomes false if the word "closed" is omitted. Extend the result to vector-valued functions. (Hint: Let the graph of $g$ be a straight line on each of the segments which constitute the complement of $E$ [compare Exercise 2.29]. The result remains true if $\R^1$ is replaced by any metric space, but the proof is not so simple.)
    \item Let $(X,d_X)$ and $(Y,d_Y)$ be metric spaces, and let $f:E\to Y$ where $E$ is a compact subset of $X$. Consider the \textbf{graph} $G\subset X\times Y$ of $f$, where the metric on $X\times Y$ is $d=d_X+d_Y$, i.e., $d[(x_1,y_1),(x_2,y_2)]=d_X(x_1,x_2)+d_Y(y_1,y_2)$. Show that $f$ is continuous if and only if $G$ is compact. (Hint: There are several ways of doing this. There is a "topological" proof that only uses the fact that compact sets are closed in a metric space, and the fact that a function is continuous if and only if pre-images of closed sets are closed. Another way to go about it is to use sequential compactness [i.e., any sequence contained in a compact set has a convergent subsequence].)
    \item If $E\subset X$ and if $f$ is a function defined on $X$, the \textbf{restriction} of $f$ to $E$ is the function $g$ whose domain of definition is $E$ such that $g(p)=f(p)$ for $p\in E$. Define $f$ and $g$ on $\R^2$ by
    \begin{align*}
        f(x,y) &=
        \begin{cases}
            0 & (x,y)=(0,0)\\
            \frac{xy^2}{x^2+y^4} & (x,y)\neq(0,0)
        \end{cases}&
        g(x,y) &=
        \begin{cases}
            0 & (x,y)=(0,0)\\
            \frac{xy^2}{x^2+y^6} & (x,y)\neq(0,0)
        \end{cases}
    \end{align*}
    Prove that $f$ is bounded on $\R^2$, that $g$ is unbounded in every neighborhood of $(0,0)$, and that $f$ is not continuous at $(0,0)$; nevertheless, the restrictions of both $f$ and $g$ to every straight line in $\R^2$ are continuous!
    \item Let $f$ be a real uniformly continuous function on the bounded set $E$ in $\R^1$. Prove that $f$ is bounded on $E$. Show that the conclusion is false if boundedness of $E$ is omitted from the hypothesis.
    \item Show that the requirement in the definition of uniform continuity can be rephrased as follows, in terms of diameters of sets: To every $\epsilon>0$, there exists a $\delta>0$ such that $\diam f(E)<\epsilon$ for all $E\subset X$ with $\diam E<\delta$.
    \item Complete the details of the following alternative proof of Theorem 4.19: If $f$ is not uniformly continuous, then for some $\epsilon>0$, there are sequences $\{p_n\},\{q_n\}$ in $X$ such that $d_X(p_n,q_n)\to 0$ but $d_Y(f(p_n),f(q_n))>\epsilon$. Use Theorem 2.37 to obtain a contradiction.
    \item Suppose $f$ is a uniformly continuous mapping of a metric space $X$ into a metric space $Y$ and prove that $\{f(x_n)\}$ is a Cauchy sequence in $Y$ for every Cauchy sequence $\{x_n\}$ in $X$. Use this result to give an alternative proof of the theorem stated in Exercise 4.13.
    \item A uniformly continuous function of a uniformly continuous function is uniformly continuous. State this more precisely and prove it.
    \item Let $E$ be a dense subset of a metric space $X$ and let $f$ be a uniformly continuous \emph{real} function defined on $E$. Prove that $f$ has a continuous extension from $E$ to $X$ (see Exercise 4.5 for terminology). Uniqueness follows from Exercise 4.4. (Hint: For each $p\in X$ and each positive integer $n$, let $V_n(p)$ be the set of all $q\in E$ with $d(p,q)<1/n$. Use Exercise 4.9 to show that the intersection of the closures of the sets $f(V_1(p)),f(V_2(p)),\dots$ consists of a single point, say $g(p)$, of $\R^1$. Prove that the function $g$ so defined on $X$ is the desired extension of $f$.) Could the range space $\R^1$ be replaced by $\R^k$? By any compact metric space? By any complete metric space? By any metric space?
    \item Let $I=[0,1]$ be the closed unit interval. Suppose $f$ is a continuous mapping of $I$ into $I$. Prove that $f(x)=x$ for at least one $x\in I$.
    \item Call a mapping of $X$ into $Y$ open if $f(V)$ is an open set in $Y$ whenever $V$ is an open set in $X$. Prove that every continuous open mapping of $\R^1$ into $\R^1$ is monotonic.
