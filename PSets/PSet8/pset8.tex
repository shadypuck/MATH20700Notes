\section{Continuity}
\emph{From \textcite{bib:Rudin}.}
\subsection*{Chapter 4}
\begin{enumerate}[label={\textbf{\arabic*.}}]
    \item \marginnote{11/29:}Suppose $f$ is a real function defined on $\R^1$ which satisfies
    \begin{equation*}
        \lim_{h\to 0}[f(x+h)-f(x-h)] = 0
    \end{equation*}
    for every $x\in\R^1$. Does this imply that $f$ is continuous?
    \item If $f$ is a continuous mapping of a metric space $X$ into a metric space $Y$, prove that
    \begin{equation*}
        f(\bar{E}) \subset \overline{f(E)}
    \end{equation*}
    for every set $E\subset X$ ($\bar{E}$ denotes the closure of $E$). Show, by an example, that $f(\bar{E})$ can be a proper subset of $\overline{f(E)}$.
    \item Let $f$ be a continuous real function on a metric space $X$. Let $Z(f)$ (the \textbf{zero set} of $f$) be the set of all $p\in X$ at which $f(p)=0$. Prove that $Z(f)$ is closed.
    \item Let $f$ and $g$ be continuous mappings of a metric space $X$ into a metric space $Y$, and let $E$ be a dense subset of $X$. Prove that $f(E)$ is dense in $f(X)$. If $g(p)=f(p)$ for all $p\in E$, prove that $g(p)=f(p)$ for all $p\in X$. (In other words, a continuous mapping is determined by its values on a dense subset of its domain.)
    \item If $f$ is a real continuous function defined on a closed set $E\subset\R^1$, prove that there exist continuous real functions $g$ on $\R^1$ such that $g(x)=f(x)$ for all $x\in E$. (Such functions $g$ are called \textbf{continuous extensions} of $f$ from $E$ to $\R^1$.) Show that the result becomes false if the word "closed" is omitted. Extend the result to vector-valued functions. (Hint: Let the graph of $g$ be a straight line on each of the segments which constitute the complement of $E$ [compare Exercise 2.29]. The result remains true if $\R^1$ is replaced by any metric space, but the proof is not so simple.)
    \item Let $(X,d_X)$ and $(Y,d_Y)$ be metric spaces, and let $f:E\to Y$ where $E$ is a compact subset of $X$. Consider the \textbf{graph} $G\subset X\times Y$ of $f$, where the metric on $X\times Y$ is $d=d_X+d_Y$, i.e., $d[(x_1,y_1),(x_2,y_2)]=d_X(x_1,x_2)+d_Y(y_1,y_2)$. Show that $f$ is continuous if and only if $G$ is compact. (Hint: There are several ways of doing this. There is a "topological" proof that only uses the fact that compact sets are closed in a metric space, and the fact that a function is continuous if and only if pre-images of closed sets are closed. Another way to go about it is to use sequential compactness [i.e., any sequence contained in a compact set has a convergent subsequence].)
    \item If $E\subset X$ and if $f$ is a function defined on $X$, the \textbf{restriction} of $f$ to $E$ is the function $g$ whose domain of definition is $E$ such that $g(p)=f(p)$ for $p\in E$. Define $f$ and $g$ on $\R^2$ by
    \begin{align*}
        f(x,y) &=
        \begin{cases}
            0 & (x,y)=(0,0)\\
            \frac{xy^2}{x^2+y^4} & (x,y)\neq(0,0)
        \end{cases}&
        g(x,y) &=
        \begin{cases}
            0 & (x,y)=(0,0)\\
            \frac{xy^2}{x^2+y^6} & (x,y)\neq(0,0)
        \end{cases}
    \end{align*}
    Prove that $f$ is bounded on $\R^2$, that $g$ is unbounded in every neighborhood of $(0,0)$, and that $f$ is not continuous at $(0,0)$; nevertheless, the restrictions of both $f$ and $g$ to every straight line in $\R^2$ are continuous!
    \item Let $f$ be a real uniformly continuous function on the bounded set $E$ in $\R^1$. Prove that $f$ is bounded on $E$. Show that the conclusion is false if boundedness of $E$ is omitted from the hypothesis.
    \item Show that the requirement in the definition of uniform continuity can be rephrased as follows, in terms of diameters of sets: To every $\epsilon>0$, there exists a $\delta>0$ such that $\diam f(E)<\epsilon$ for all $E\subset X$ with $\diam E<\delta$.
    \item Complete the details of the following alternative proof of Theorem 4.19: If $f$ is not uniformly continuous, then for some $\epsilon>0$, there are sequences $\{p_n\},\{q_n\}$ in $X$ such that $d_X(p_n,q_n)\to 0$ but $d_Y(f(p_n),f(q_n))>\epsilon$. Use Theorem 2.37 to obtain a contradiction.
    \item Suppose $f$ is a uniformly continuous mapping of a metric space $X$ into a metric space $Y$ and prove that $\{f(x_n)\}$ is a Cauchy sequence in $Y$ for every Cauchy sequence $\{x_n\}$ in $X$. Use this result to give an alternative proof of the theorem stated in Exercise 4.13.
    \item A uniformly continuous function of a uniformly continuous function is uniformly continuous. State this more precisely and prove it.
    \item Let $E$ be a dense subset of a metric space $X$ and let $f$ be a uniformly continuous \emph{real} function defined on $E$. Prove that $f$ has a continuous extension from $E$ to $X$ (see Exercise 4.5 for terminology). Uniqueness follows from Exercise 4.4. (Hint: For each $p\in X$ and each positive integer $n$, let $V_n(p)$ be the set of all $q\in E$ with $d(p,q)<1/n$. Use Exercise 4.9 to show that the intersection of the closures of the sets $f(V_1(p)),f(V_2(p)),\dots$ consists of a single point, say $g(p)$, of $\R^1$. Prove that the function $g$ so defined on $X$ is the desired extension of $f$.) Could the range space $\R^1$ be replaced by $\R^k$? By any compact metric space? By any complete metric space? By any metric space?
    \item Let $I=[0,1]$ be the closed unit interval. Suppose $f$ is a continuous mapping of $I$ into $I$. Prove that $f(x)=x$ for at least one $x\in I$.
    \item Call a mapping of $X$ into $Y$ open if $f(V)$ is an open set in $Y$ whenever $V$ is an open set in $X$. Prove that every continuous open mapping of $\R^1$ into $\R^1$ is monotonic.
    \item Let $[x]$ denote the largest integer contained in $x$, that is, $[x]$ is the integer such that $x-1<[x]\leq x$; and let $(x)=x-[x]$ denote the fractional part of $x$. What discontinuities do the functions $[x]$ and $(x)$ have?
    \item Let $f$ be a real function defined on $(a,b)$. Prove that the set of points at which $f$ has a simple discontinuity is at most countable. (Hint: Let $E$ be the set on which $f(x-)<f(x+)$. With each point $x$ of $E$, associate a triple $(p,q,r)$ of rational numbers such that
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item $f(x-)<p<f(x+)$;
        \item $a<q<t<x$ implies $f(t)<p$;
        \item $x<t<r<b$ implies $f(t)>p$.
    \end{enumerate}
    The set of all such triples is countable. Show that each triple is associated with at most one point of $E$. Deal similarly with the other possible types of simple discontinuities.)
    \item Every rational $x$ can be written in the form $x=m/n$, where $n>0$ and $m$ and $n$ are integers without any common divisors. When $x=0$, we take $n=1$. Consider the function $f$ defined on $\R^1$ by
    \begin{equation*}
        f(x) =
        \begin{cases}
            0 & x\notin\Q\\
            \frac{1}{n} & x=\frac{m}{n}
        \end{cases}
    \end{equation*}
    Prove that $f$ is continuous at every irrational point, and that $f$ has a simple discontinuity at every rational point.
    \item Suppose $f$ is a real function with domain $\R^1$ which has the intermediate value property: If $f(a)<c<f(b)$, then $f(x)=c$ for some $x$ between $a$ and $b$. Suppose also, for every rational $r$, that the set of all $x$ with $f(x)=r$ is closed. Prove that $f$ is continuous. (Hint: If $x_n\to x_0$, but $f(x_n)>r>f(x_0)$ for some $r$ and all $n$, then $f(t_n)=r$ for some $t_n$ between $x_0$ and $x_n$; thus, $t_n\to x_0$. Find a contradiction. \parencite{bib:Fine}.)
    \item If $E$ is a nonempty subset of a metric space $X$, define the \textbf{distance} from $x\in X$ to $E$ by
    \begin{equation*}
        \rho_E(x) = \inf_{z\in E}d(x,z)
    \end{equation*}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Prove that $\rho_E(x)=0$ if and only if $x\in\bar{E}$.
        \item Prove that $\rho_E$ is a uniformly continuous function on $X$, by showing that
        \begin{equation*}
            |\rho_E(x)-\rho_E(y)| \leq d(x,y)
        \end{equation*}
        for all $x,y\in X$. (Hint: $\rho_E(x)\leq d(x,z)\leq d(x,y)+d(y,z)$, so that $\rho_E(x)\leq d(x,y)+\rho_E(y)$.)
    \end{enumerate}
    \item Suppose $K$ compact and $F$ closed are disjoint sets in a metric space $X$. Prove that there exists $\delta>0$ such that $d(p,q)>\delta$ if $p\in K$, $q\in F$. (Hint: $\rho_F$ is a continuous positive function on $K$.) Show that the conclusion may fail for two disjoint closed sets if neither is compact.
    \item Let $A$ and $B$ be disjoint nonempty closed sets in a metric space $X$, and define
    \begin{equation*}
        f(p) = \frac{\rho_A(p)}{\rho_A(p)+\rho_B(p)}
    \end{equation*}
    for all $p\in X$. Show that $f$ is a continuous function on $X$ whose range lies in $[0,1]$, that $f(p)=0$ precisely on $A$, and that $f(p)=1$ precisely on $B$. This establishes a converse of Exercise 4.3: Every closed set $A\subset X$ is $Z(f)$ for some continuous real $f$ on $X$. Setting
    \begin{align*}
        V &= f^{-1}([0,\tfrac{1}{2}))&
        W &= f^{-1}((\tfrac{1}{2},1])
    \end{align*}
    show that $V$ and $W$ are open and disjoint, and that $A\subset V$, $B\subset W$. (Thus pairs of disjoint closed sets in a metric space can be covered by pairs of disjoint open sets. This property of metric spaces is called \textbf{normality}.)
    \item A real-valued function $f$ defined in $(a,b)$ is said to be \textbf{convex} if
    \begin{equation*}
        f(\lambda x+(1-\lambda)y) \leq \lambda f(x)+(1-\lambda)f(y)
    \end{equation*}
    whenever $a<x<b$, $a<y<b$, and $0<\lambda<1$. Prove that every convex function is continuous. Prove that every increasing convex function of a convex function is convex. (For example, if $f$ is convex, so is $\e[f]$.) If $f$ is convex in $(a,b)$ and if $a<s<t<u<b$, show that
    \begin{equation*}
        \frac{f(t)-f(s)}{t-s} \leq \frac{f(u)-f(s)}{u-s} \leq \frac{f(u)-f(t)}{u-t}
    \end{equation*}
    \item Assume that $f$ is a continuous real function defined in $(a,b)$ such that
    \begin{equation*}
        f\left( \frac{x+y}{2} \right) \leq \frac{f(x)+f(y)}{2}
    \end{equation*}
    for all $x,y\in(a,b)$. Prove that $f$ is convex.
    \item If $A,B\subset\R^k$, define $A+B$ to be the set of all sums $\x+\y$ with $\x\in A$, $\y\in B$.
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item If $K$ is compact and $C$ is closed in $\R^k$, prove that $K+C$ is closed. (Hint: Take $\z\notin K+C$, put $F=\z-C$, the set of all $\z-\y$ with $\y\in C$. Then $K$ and $F$ are disjoint. Choose $\delta$ as in Exercise 4.21. Show that the open ball with center $\z$ and radius $\delta$ does not intersect $K+C$.)
        \item Let $\alpha$ be an irrational real number. Let $C_1$ be the set of all integers, and let $C_2$ be the set of all $n\alpha$ with $n\in C_1$. Show that $C_1$ and $C_2$ are closed subsets of $\R^1$ whose sum $C_1+C_2$ is \emph{not} closed, by showing that $C_1+C_2$ is a countable dense subset of $\R^1$.
    \end{enumerate}
    \item Suppose $X,Y,Z$ are metric spaces, and $Y$ is compact. Let $f:X\to Y$, let $g:Y\to Z$ be continuous and 1-1, and let $h(x)=g(f(x))$ for all $x\in X$. Prove that $f$ is uniformly continuous if $h$ is uniformly continuous. (Hint: $g^{-1}$ has compact domain $g(Y)$, and $f(x)=g^{-1}(h(x))$.) Prove also that $f$ is continuous if $h$ is continuous. Show (by modifying Example 4.21, or by finding a different example) that the compactness of $Y$ cannot be omitted from the hypotheses, even when $X$ and $Z$ are compact.
\end{enumerate}
